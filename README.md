# Imperial25.Clustering
TBD

### Left to do

1. Run the pipeline with 3-5 datasets, and see what the Lambda and Bandwidths on DIBmix return with. Then set a value accordingly. (This will have to be done by Efthymios)
2. Run the investigation with all preferred (15 ish) real life datasets.
3. Create visualisations for the results and the poster and handle results.
4. Write up report, design poster. 
    On the report, datasets section nearly done.
    Must also add, restraints and problems that we adapted around (categorical, DIB bug, auto categorical detector?)
    Then results and conclusion, this goes hand-in-hand with 3.
